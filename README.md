# Kaggle-Deep-Learning-Model
In this assignment, I'm required to build a deep learning model for identifying  120  different breeds of dogs. Similar to the previous assignment, required to use real images from the Kaggle competition.

In this assignment, I'm required to use a ResNet network. We use ResNet implementation provided in PyTorch. Note however that there are many versions of ResNet (they differ in terms of number of layers). My task is to find the best configuration that gives the best performance.
